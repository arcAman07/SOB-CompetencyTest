# Routing Node research and automation

Description: 
Weâ€™re developing a capital management system for routing nodes named Torq. An important part of building Torq is exploring the data collected by Torq. The goal is to help routing node operators improve the efficiency and return of their invested bitcoin. This can be done in various ways, for example by automating actions based on the data that is collected, or provide hints and insight to the user. In this project you will get the opportunity to dive into several exploratory projects on the cutting edge of lightning and routing nodes.
